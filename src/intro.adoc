== Introduction

The RISC-V Hart to Trace Encoder Interface (RHTI) was originally developed (and ratified) as part of the https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-trace-spec/releases/latest/[Efficient Trace for RISC-V (E-Trace) Specification].  However, the interface itself is not E-Trace specific, and is suitable for use with any instruction and data trace encoding protocol.  As such, this document makes it  available as a standalone specification.

[[sec:terminology]]
=== Terminology

The following terms have a specific meaning in this specification.

* *branch*: an instruction which conditionally changes the execution
flow
* *CSR*: control/status register
* *decoder*: a piece of software that takes the trace packets emitted by
the encoder and reconstructs the execution flow of the code executed by
the RISC-V hart
* *discontinuity*: a change in the program counter that is other than the
difference between two instructions placed consecutively in memory
- *inferrable discontinuity*: a discontinuity in the program counter resulting from a branch or *direct jump*
- *uninferrable discontinuity*: a discontinuity in the program counter that is not inferrable (see above)
- *updiscon*: contraction of ’uninferrable PC discontinuity’
* *E-Trace*: Abbreviation of _Efficient Trace for RISC-V_
* *ELF*: executable and linkable format
* *encoder*: a piece of hardware that takes in instruction execution
information from a RISC-V hart and transforms it into trace packets
* *exception*: an unusual condition occurring at run time associated
with an instruction in a RISC-V hart
* *hart*: a RISC-V hardware thread
* *final instruction*: the instruction retired immediately before tracing stops.
* *last instruction*: in a block of sequentially retired instructions, the instruction at the end of the sequence
* *interrupt*: an external asynchronous event that may cause a RISC-V
hart to experience an unexpected transfer of control
* *ISA*: instruction set architecture
* *jump*: an instruction which unconditionally changes the execution
flow
- *direct jump*: an instruction which unconditionally changes the
execution flow by changing the PC by a constant value
- *indirect jump*: an instruction which unconditionally changes the
execution flow by changing the PC to a computed value
- *inferrable jump*: a jump where the target address is supplied via a
constant embedded within the jump opcode
- *uninferrable jump*: a jump which is not inferrable (see above)
* *LSB*: least significant bit
* *MSB*: most significant bit
* *packet*: the atomic unit of encoded trace information emitted by the
encoder
* *PC*: program counter
* *program counter*: a register containing the address of the
instruction being executed
* *retire*: the final stage of executing an instruction, when the
machine state is updated (sometimes referred to as ’commit’ or
’graduate’)
* *RHTI* RISC-V Hart to Trace Encoder Interface (this specification)
* *trap*: the transfer of control to a trap handler caused by either an
exception or an interrupt


=== Nomenclature

In the following sections items in *bold* are signals or fields within a
packet.

Items in *_bold italics_* are mnemonics for instructions defined in the RISC-V ISA

Items `lowlighted` are CSRs or other registers defined in the RISC-V ISA

Items in _italics_ with names ending _’_p’_ refer to parameters either
built into the hardware or configurable hardware values.
